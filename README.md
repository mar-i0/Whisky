This tool enables users to convert speech to text and process the resulting input using GPT-3.5, a powerful language processing AI model. The output is then returned through the speakers for easy listening.


## Installation

This piece of code is developed for Windows 10 using Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
This software uses the language configured in the operating system by default. Therefore, if your operating system is in Spanish, you can use Spanish to speak into the microphone. However, if it is in English, you will need to ask GPT questions in English.
To use this tool, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Once you have that, clone this repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the Whisky.py file and speak into your microphone. The tool will capture your speech, convert it to text, process it using GPT-3.5, and return the output through your speakers.

python Whisky.py

<audio controls>
  <source src="recitame.ogg" type="audio/mpeg">

</audio>

## Customization

You can customize the tool by adjusting the GPT-3.5 parameters. You can also modify the tool to perform other actions with the text output, such as sending it to a database or using it to control other devices.
