This tool enables users to convert speech to text and process the resulting input using GPT-3.5, a powerful language processing AI model. The output is then returned through the speakers for easy listening.


## Installation

This piece of code is developed for Windows 10 using Microsoft Visual Studio Code.
To use this tool, you'll need an OpenAI API key. Once you have that, clone this repository and install the required dependencies using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt


## Usage

To use the tool, simply run the voice_to_text.py file and speak into your microphone. The tool will capture your speech, convert it to text, process it using GPT-3.5, and return the output through your speakers.

python Whisky.py


## Customization

You can customize the tool by adjusting the GPT-3.5 parameters. You can also modify the tool to perform other actions with the text output, such as sending it to a database or using it to control other devices.
